# Sock bundle — build your own pack

Ported from the BOM Socks theme (Foesta) to Impulse. Shoppers pick a pack size
(1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5), choose each sock from a picker grid, and the matching Shopify
discount code is applied when the pack is added to cart.

## Files

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `templates/product.bundle-builder.json` | Product template for a "build your own pack" product. |
| `snippets/sock-bundle.liquid` | Pack cards, progress bar, chosen-sock slots, total and add-to-cart button (info column). |
| `snippets/sock-bundle-picker.liquid` | The sock picker grid (image column on desktop, inline on mobile). |
| `snippets/sock-bundle-picker-card.liquid` | One sock card in the picker. |
| `assets/sock-bundle.js` | The `<sock-bundle>` element: pack logic, slots, add to cart, discount redirect. |
| `assets/sock-bundle.css` | All styling, using Impulse's colour variables. |
| `snippets/product-template.liquid` | Wires the picker into the image column and renders the block. |
| `sections/main-product.liquid` | Adds the **Sock bundle (pack size)** block to the product section. |

## Setup

1. Create a product to act as the bundle (e.g. "Build Your Own Pack"). Give it a
   price and image; the price is not what customers pay — they pay for the socks they pick.
2. In the product admin, set **Theme template** to `bundle-builder`.
3. In **Shopify admin → Discounts**, create one code per pack (2, 3, 4, 5 socks):
   - Amount off products, percentage matching the pack (10 / 15 / 20 / 20)
   - Applies to the sock collection used in the picker
   - **Minimum quantity of items** = the pack size, so a code cannot be used on fewer socks
4. In the theme editor, open a product using the `bundle-builder` template, select the
   **Sock bundle (pack size)** block and paste each code into its pack. Check the
   **Socks customers can choose from** collection (defaults to `all-socks`).

**Discount percent** on each pack is display only — it drives the running total and
the free-shipping bar, so keep it equal to the real discount.

## Behaviour

- Adding to cart posts every chosen sock to `/cart/add.js`, then redirects through
  `/discount/<CODE>?redirect=/cart` so the code sticks to the cart. The code used is the
  one for how many socks are actually in the pack, not the card that was clicked.
- Shopify allows one discount code per order; this one replaces any existing code.
- Discount codes are visible in the page source; the minimum-quantity rule keeps that safe.
- The free-shipping marker and wording only appear when the maths reaches the threshold,
  or when a pack has **This pack includes free shipping** ticked (back that with a real
  shipping rule or free-shipping code).
- On a normal product page the block can also be added: **Single** then means "buy this
  product" and the normal add-to-cart stays; multi-packs switch into the picker.
- Below 769px the picker moves inline under the chosen-sock slots.
